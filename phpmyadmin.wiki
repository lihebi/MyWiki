== install ==
on mac:

port can install, and it will install it into /opt/local/www

so copy the entire phpmyadmin directory into your site directory(~/Sites/)
then you will get #202 error:
{{{class="brush: shell"
cp config.sample.inc.php config.inc.php
vi config.inc.php
}}}
change
`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = 'localhost';`
to
`$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1';`

if username or passwd is incorrect, you'll get #1045
